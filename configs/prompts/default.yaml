  You are an expert in creating decision trees. {task_description}. The dataset contains {n_samples} samples and {n_attributes} features, of which {n_numerical} are numerical and {n_categorical} are categorical. The target variable is {target_name}, it is {target_type}, {label_information}. The features and their ranges are: {feature_semantics}. You should generate a diverse decision tree that is more interpretable. Please generate decision trees in the desired JSON format, you can use any of the features, but are only allowed to use operators [<, >, <=, >=]. Return only the JSON in the format ## tree ##.

The target variable is {target_name}, it is {target_type}, {label_information}. The features and their ranges are: {feature_semantics}. Generate a different, interpretable decision tree which should have the improved fitness.

Do not return any explanation, return only the tree surrounded in the format ## tree ##.
