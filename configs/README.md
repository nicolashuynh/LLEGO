## About configurations

The system uses a modular configuration approach centered on the main `llego.yaml` file. This file references component-specific configurations stored in dedicated subdirectories (e.g., `crossover/default.yaml`, `mutation/default.yaml`). This structure allows you to modify individual components independently while maintaining a clean overall configuration hierarchy.
